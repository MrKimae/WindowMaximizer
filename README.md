# WindowMaximizer
This is a very simple command line tool to make games run in windowed borderless mode, in case they don't support it.
I made this because Modern Warfare 2 used to crash when i Alt-Tabbed out of it.

The easiest way to use this app is to launch it before the game in a batch file. 
The app will run until it finds the correct window, maximize it, remove decorations, then exit.
